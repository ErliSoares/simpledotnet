#summary Customized localized configuration description


= Introduction =

Simple.NET implements it's own configuration system. Relying on XML standard, the framework provides a elegant way to write configuration definitions. All the configuration is automatically localizable. You don't have even to explicitly tell to configuration manager which location you want.

= Sample =

Suppose it's need to store a string and an integer inside a XML file. The XML structure will look like this:

{{{
<myConfig>
  <someInt>42</someInt>
  <someString>forty-two</someString>
</myConfig>
}}}
